# Lichen: Code Similarity Checker (APCS Final Project)

Lichen aims to be an automatic system for determining the similarity of programs. It primarily aims to assist computer science teachers combat plagiarism and cheating by cross-checking code sources from individual students, but may have other applications as well, such as in search engines or autograding code.

Related projects include Stanford's [MOSS](http://moss.stanford.edu/) but I wanted to try making one on my own.


## Overall Design

Lichen is split into two parts: an API backend accessible through HTTP, and and a frontend. The rationale for separating the project this way is to allow it to be more extensible. Users won't just be limited to one client that may or may not serve their needs; if they need something, they can easily build something on top of the API. In fact, most use cases (especially automated ones) would want to use the API. The official client is provided for demo purposes and as a sample.


## Elixir Backend

The backend will be in charge of all the code crunching with a callable API that takes in two or more code samples and returns the result of the similarity checking. It does all the heavy lifting so the client only has to call the backend and display the results. I have decided to implement the backend in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). Why, you ask? Well, I like Elixir üëç

The algorithm in use is called winnowing. Each code sample will first be preprocessed based on the language, removing keywords and turning variable names into generic names, and then that sequence of tokens is hashed somehow by looking at n-grams. This generates a method that can detect partial matches and is resistant to simple changes like reordering or renaming.

The backend will also store intermediate results of the algorithm, such as the sequence of tokens, into a database such as MongoDB to quickly find matches. This will also allow Lichen to build up a large database of fingerprints over time, potentially being able to alert teachers of unknown plagiarism.


## Java Client

The sample frontend will be implemented in Java because the project requires me to do so. (I would have much preferred to make a web frontend with React.) I will use Swing to render a basic UI with textboxes for the user to paste code into, a button to submit the code to the API, and another box to display the results. This should be relatively minimal as there is not much logic here; only the UI which connects to the API.

The code for this portion will be fairly simple, so I can't come up with the list of data structures I'm going to use here at the moment. There's a good chance that I'm going to need to use one of them, but I can't think of where I would use them in the Java portion off the top of my head. However, I will be using equivalent data structures in the backend.


## Structural Design Table

I'm not too sure what to put here. Although the project is complex, there really aren't that many structures to use. If I run across more, I'll update this table.

| Data            | Structure                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code Samples    | List of strings (Elixir: Linked List, Java: Array List) |
| Tokenized Code  | Linked List of tokens                                   |
| Checker Results | Custom type (Elixir: Struct, Java: Object)              |

Why linked lists? Well, Elixir employes a functional programming style that makes heavy use of linked lists. Think about it: functional programming encourages immutability and data sharing. Being able to append to the head of a list in O(1) time means you can build them up step-by-step. Recursion¬†(also heavily used in FP) also works significantly better on lists than arrays. I don't require randomly accessing elements of the list in O(1) time, only operating on them through iteration, so they work perfectly in this case.


## (Somewhat) Object Oriented Design

This is a basic outline of how Lichen will be laid out. Since I'm using Elixir, which is not an object-oriented language, in the backend, this won't correspond perfectly to how the project is actually implemented. It will most likely use behaviors instead of interfaces and structs instead of classes.
